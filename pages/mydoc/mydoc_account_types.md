## Account Types

YNAB offers a list of preset **account types**. In this guide, they are colour labeled for explanation purposes: the income accounts usually have a <span class="label label-success">positive</span> balance, whereas the debt accounts have a <span class="label label-danger">negative</span> balance:

* <span class="label label-success">positive</span>  **Checking Account**. It is one of the main accounts you spend from, for example, your payroll card.
*  <span class="label label-success">positive</span>  **Savings Account**. This account keeps your savings for short-term future purchases or services, for example travel or emergency funds.
*  <span class="label label-danger">negative</span>  **Credit Card**. This is an account you borrow from. It is important that you offset this debt with the [money transfer](mydoc_transferring_money) from another account.
*  <span class="label label-success">positive</span>  **Cash**. This account keeps track of your cash transactions.
*  <span class="label label-danger">negative</span>  **Line of Credit or Other Credit**. Similar to **Credit Card**, this is another account you borrow from, and you need to settle this debt with the [money transfer](mydoc_transferring_money) from another account.
*  <span class="label label-success">positive</span>  **Paypal**. This account is for payments that go through your Paypal account.
*  <span class="label label-success">positive</span>  **Merchant Account**. Similar to **Checking Account**, this is another account you spend from.
*  <span class="label label-success">positive</span>  **Investment Account**. This account keeps your savings for long-term future goals, such as education or retirement.
*  <span class="label label-danger">negative</span>  **Mortgage**. This account tracks your mortgage payments.
*  <span class="label label-success">positive</span>  **Other Asset (House, Car, etc)**. This account is similar to **Investment Account** and keeps your savings for big property purchases.
*  <span class="label label-danger">negative</span>  **Other Loan or Liability**. This account is similar to **Mortgage** and tracks any loan payments you might have.


## Account Categories

All YNAB accounts fall under two **account categories**:

*  **Budget**. These accounts finance your budget. They are the sources that cover your expenses. **Checking**, **Savings**, **Credit Card**, **Cash**, **Line of Credit or Other Credit**, **Paypal**, and **Merchant** accounts are usually included in the budget.
*  **Off-Budget**. These accounts do not affect your budget and, as such, do not have budget categories. They track the money that you pull out of your budget and set aside for specific purposes. Usually **Investment**, **Other Asset**, **Mortgage**, and **Other Loan or Liability** accounts are off-budget.
