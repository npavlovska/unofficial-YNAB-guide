**Accounts** are the main sources of your income and expenses that show where the money comes from and goes to. They reflect what you earn and what type of liabilities, such as loans, insurance, rent, and mortgages, you have. Accounts are frameworks for recording inflow and outflow transactions that track income, expenses, and savings.
