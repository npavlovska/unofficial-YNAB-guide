If you happen to assign a transaction to a wrong category, you can always reassign it.
When deleting a budget category, consider reassigning all of its transactions to other categories. Otherwise they will become uncategorized and will no longer affect your budget.

## 1. To reassign a transaction:

1.  In the blue navigation pane on the left, select an account with the transaction you want to reassign. <br/>This opens a list of account transactions.

2.  In the transactions list, click to highlight the transaction you want to reassign.

3.  Click its **Category** field and select another category from the drop-down list.
    {% include image.html file="ReassignTransaction.png" alt="Reassigning a transaction" %}

4.  Click **Done**.

    {% include tip.html content="Another way to reassign a transaction is to right-click it, select **Categorize As** from the context menu, and select the appropriate category." %}

{% include links.html %}
