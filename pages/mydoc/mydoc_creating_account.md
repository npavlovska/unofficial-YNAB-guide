## To create an account:

1.  In the blue navigation pane on the left, select **+ Add Account**. <br/>This opens the **Create a New Account** window.
    {% include image.html file="CreateAccount.png" alt="Creating an account" %}

2.  Fill in the details:
    * **Name**. Type in the name of the account.
    * **Current Balance**. Specify current positive or negative balance depending on the account type. You can always change it later if needed.
    * **Date of Current Balance**. Set the date, which is usually the current date.
    * **Type**. Select the [account type](mydoc_account_types) from the drop-down list.
    * **Budget Account** or **Off-Budget**. Select the desired [account category](mydoc_account_types.html#account-categories).

3.  Click **Create Account**. <br/>You can now see the account and its balance in the blue navigation pane on the left.

After you create an account, a new transaction with the current balance is automatically recorded in a list of account transactions. To access the list, select the account In the blue navigation pane on the left.

The new transaction is assigned to a preset **Starting Balance** payee and a preset category that depends on the type and category of the account:

*  **Income for current month** for a budget account with a positive balance.
*  **Pre-YNAB debt** for a budget account with a negative balance.
*  No category for an off-budget account. Transactions in off-budget accounts do not have budget categories.
