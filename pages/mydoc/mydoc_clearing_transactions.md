New transactions are uncleared by default. Making them cleared means completing and confirming them. If you think some details, such as amount, payee, or date might change, leave the transaction uncleared. For example, you can add an outflow transaction right after preordering goods in an online store, but make it cleared after you are charged for the order.

To clear a transaction, click the dimmed **Cleared** button  {% include inline_image.html file="Uncleared_Button.png" alt="Uncleared button" %}  on the right side of the transaction. When the dimmed button switches to green {% include inline_image.html file="Cleared_Button.png" alt="Ð¡leared button" %}, the transaction becomes cleared.

{% include tip.html content="Another way to clear a transaction is to right-click it and select **Mark as Cleared** from the context menu." %}
