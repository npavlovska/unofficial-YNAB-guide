New transactions are uncleared by default. Making them cleared means that they are completed and, as such, confirmed. If you think that the transaction could change, leave it uncleared. For example, after placing an order with an online store, add a corresponding outflow transaction, but make it cleared only after you are charged for the order.

To clear a transaction, click the dimmed **Cleared** button  {% include inline_image.html file="Uncleared_Button.png" alt="Uncleared button" %}  on the right side of the transaction. When the dimmed button switches to green {% include inline_image.html file="Cleared_Button.png" alt="Ð¡leared button" %}, the transaction becomes cleared.

{% include tip.html content="Another way to clear a transaction is to right-click it and select **Mark as Cleared** from the context menu." %}
