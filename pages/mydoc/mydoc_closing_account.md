If you no longer need an account, you can close it. The action removes it from the budget but keeps it available in case you might want to reopen it in the future.

## To close an account:

1.  In the blue navigation pane on the left, right-click the account you wish to close. <br/>This opens the **Edit Account** window.
    {% include image.html file="EditAccount.png" alt="Closing an account" %}

2.  Click **Close Account** in the lower left corner. <br/>You can now see the account in the **Closed Accounts** section in the blue navigation pane on the left.

 {% include links.html %}
