Considering how easy it is to [add payees](mydoc_adding_payees), you might end up with different versions of the same payee that, for example, have different spelling. To keep payees consistent, rename the duplicates until all of them match. As soon as you finish renaming, the duplicates will automatically disappear from the list of existing payees.

## To rename a payee:

1.  In the top menu select **View** > **Go to Payee Settings**. <br/>This opens a window with a list of payees.

2.  From the list on the left, select a payee you want to rename.

3.  Click **Rename**. <br/>This displays a field with the current name that you can change.

4.  Type in the new name and click **Save**. <br/>The new name is now applied to all transactions assigned to this payee.

5.  Click **Close**.
