A **budget** is a file that contains detailed information on everything you earn and spend. It is a framework for tracking the money flow with transactions assigned to certain accounts and categories. It keeps your finances organized and allows you to quickly assess your financial situation.

Creating a budget file is the first step in setting up your personal monthly budget.

## To create a budget:

1.  Start YNAB client.
2.  In the menu bar at the top, select **File** > **Create a New Budget...**
    <br/>This opens the **Budget Setup** window.<br/>
    {% include image.html file="CreateBudget.png"  alt="Create budget" %}
3.  In the **Budget Name** field, type the name of your budget.
4.  Under the prompt **Cloud Sync this budget?** select the appropriate option:
*  If you plan to use the budget on multiple devices, select **Yes, Cloud Sync this budget**.
*  If you plan to use the budget only on your PC, select **No, make it local**.
5.  Under **Starting Categories** select **Personal/Family**. This budget option contains a set of budget categories that cover the most common personal living expenses.
    <br/>There is also available a [Small Business](https://www.youneedabudget.com/tag/small-business-owners/) option with a different set of categories, which this guide does not cover.<br/>
6.  Under **Currency & Date Formats** select your preferred currency, currency format, and date format from the drop-down lists.
7.  Click **Create Budget**.
    <br/>This completes the process of creating a budget.<br/>
