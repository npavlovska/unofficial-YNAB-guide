If you happen to add a wrong transaction or duplicate an existing one, you can always delete it.

## To delete a transaction:

1.  In the blue navigation pane on the left, select an account with the transaction you wish to delete. <br/>This opens a list of account transactions.

2.  In the transactions list, click to highlight the transaction you wish to delete.

3.  Press the Delete key on your keyboard.

    {% include tip.html content="Another way to delete a transaction is to right-click it and select **Delete** from the context menu." %}

## To reinstate a deleted transaction:

{% include warning.html content="The **Undo** option is only available immediately after you delete a transaction. " %}

To reinstate a transaction, click the **Undo** button in the upper-right corner above the transactions list.
