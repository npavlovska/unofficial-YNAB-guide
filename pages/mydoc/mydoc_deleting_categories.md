When deleting a category, remember that all its transactions will become uncategorized and will no longer affect your budget. If you want to ensure that deleting a category does not affect your budget history, first [reassign its transactions](mydoc_reassigning_transactions) to other categories.

If you do not want to reassign transactions, consider [hiding the category](mydoc_hiding_categories) instead of deleting it.

## To delete a category:

1.  Click the category you want to delete. <br/>This opens the **Edit category** dialog box (or **Edit master category** if you are deleting a master category).<br/>
    {% include image.html file="EditCategory.png" alt="Deleting a category" caption="Deleting a category" %}
    {% include image.html file="EditMasterCategory.png" alt="Deleting a master category" caption="Deleting a master category" %}

2.  Click the red link:
    *  **Delete this category** for a category.
    *  **Delete this master category (and its categories)** for a master category.
        {% include warning.html content="Deleting a master category also removes all of its categories." %}

3.  Click **Done**.
4.  In the dialog box that opens, confirm your action.
