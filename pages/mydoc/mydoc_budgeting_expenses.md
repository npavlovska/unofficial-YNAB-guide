After you set up [budget categories](mydoc_about_categories), [create accounts](mydoc_creating_account), and [add income](mydoc_adding_transactions), you are ready to budget expenses. Determine how much money you want to allocate for each category. Decide what categories require bigger budget than others. Calculate repetitive expenses, such as utilities and subscriptions. Determine your savings goals and emergency funds.

You need to budget money into categories once a month. Consider doing it consistently at the end of each month.

## To select a budget month:

Because YNAB is designed as a monthly budget, there is a section for each of the twelve months in the budget spreadsheet. YNAB automatically highlights current and future months, whereas previous months appear dimmed.

Select the month you need from the navigation string at the top of the budget spreadsheet. Or use the navigation buttons next to the navigation string.

The months that fit on your screen are highlighted in blue.

## To budget money into a category:

1.  In the blue navigation pane on the left, select **Budget**. <br/>This opens a budget spreadsheet.

2. In the budget spreadsheet, point to the budget category you want to fill. <br/>This highlights its entire row in grey.

3.  Select a row cell that corresponds to the **Budgeted** column of the budgeted month. Type in the amount.
