The key to maintaining an accurate financial balance is to record income and expenses as they occur. As soon as you spend or receive the money, add a corresponding transaction to your budget.

## To add a transaction:

1.  In the blue navigation pane on the left, select an account under which you want to add a transaction. <br/>This opens a list of account transactions.

2.  In the transactions list, click **+ Add a new transaction**. <br/>This creates an empty transaction.

3.  Fill in the details:
    *  **Date**. Specify the date when the transaction occurred.
    *  **Payee**. Type in a new [payee](mydoc_about_payees) or select an existing one from the drop-down list.

        {% include note.html content="When you type in a new payee, it is instantly added to a list of memorized payees." %}

    *  **Category**. Select a [budget category](mydoc_creating_categories) from the drop-down list.
    *  **Memo**. Add a personal note (optional).

4.  Specify the transaction amount:
    *  For income, type in the amount in the **Inflow** field.
    *  For expense, type in the amount in the **Outflow** field.

        {% include tip.html content="Optionally, you can [color tag a transaction](mydoc_tagging_transactions) by clicking the dimmed flag on the left side and selecting one of the offered colored flags." %}

5.  Click **Save**. <br/>If you want to add one more transaction, click **Save and add another**.

    {% include tip.html content="In the budget spreadsheet, the **Outflows** column of the budgeted month displays the amount you have spent in each category. To [check your budget balance](mydoc_budget_balance#to-check-your-budget-balance), view the budget spreadsheet by selecting **Budget** in the blue navigation pane on the left." %}
