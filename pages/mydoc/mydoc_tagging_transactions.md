To have additional sorting options, you can label transactions with colour tags. it is especially useful for grouping transactions assigned to different categories. For example, to see how much money you spend on both **Phone** and **Internet**, mark transactions in these two categories with the same colour tag.

Tags also allow you to track a certain expense without breaking up a broader category into more specific ones. For example, you can find out how much you spend on coffee takeouts, which are a part of your **Restaurants & Entertainment** category, by marking each coffee takeout transaction with a colour tag.

## To tag a transaction:

1.  In the blue navigation pane on the left, select an account with the transaction you want to tag. <br/>This opens a list of account transactions.

2.  In the transactions list, click the dimmed flag on the left side of the transaction you want to tag. <br/>This opens a selection of colour flags.

3.  Select a flag of the desired colour.
