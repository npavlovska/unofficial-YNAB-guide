To have additional sorting options, you can label transactions with color tags. it is especially useful for grouping transactions assigned to different categories. For example, to see how much money you spend on both **Phone** and **Internet**, mark transactions in these two categories with the same color tag.

Tags also allow you to track a particular expense without breaking up a broader category into several smaller ones. For example, your coffee takeouts are a part of the **Restaurants & Entertainment** category. If you want to find out how much you spend on them, mark each coffee takeout transaction with a color tag.

## To tag a transaction:

1.  In the blue navigation pane on the left, select an account with the transaction you want to tag. <br/>This opens a list of account transactions.

2.  In the transactions list, click the dimmed flag on the left side of the transaction you want to tag. <br/>This opens a selection of color flags.

3.  Select a flag of the appropriate color.
