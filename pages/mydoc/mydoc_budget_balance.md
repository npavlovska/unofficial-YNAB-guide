The goal of keeping a budget is to ensure that you spend no more than you earn. When you finish budgeting expenses, [check your budget balance](#to-check-your-budget-balance) and confirm that it is positive or equal to zero.

Keep track of your actual expenses per category. If you overspend, identify the categories in the red and [eliminate overspending](#to-identify-and-eliminate-overspending).

## To check your budget balance:

1.  In the blue navigation pane on the left, select **Budget**. <br/>This opens a budget spreadsheet.
2.  In the budget spreadsheet, check the header of the budgeted month:
    *  If it displays the **Available to Budget** amount with a zero or positive balance, the total expenses are within the limits of the total income. You budgeted well.
    *  If it displays the **Overbudgeted** amount with a negative balance, the total expenses exceed the total income. You need to eliminate overbudgeting by [adjusting the amounts budgeted into categories](mydoc_budgeting_expenses#to-budget-money-into-a-category).

## To identify and eliminate overspending:

1.  In the blue navigation pane on the left, select **Budget**. <br/>This opens a budget spreadsheet.

2.  In the budget spreadsheet, check the balance of budget categories to identify which categories exceed the budget. <br/>The amount of overspending appears as a negative number highlighted in red in the **Balance** column of the budgeted month. It is the difference between the amount of budgeted expenses (the **Budgeted** column) and the amount of expenses recorded with account transactions (the **Outflows** column).

3.  When you identify categories with overspending:
    1.  [Increase budgeted expenses](mydoc_budgeting_expenses#to-budget-money-into-a-category) in these categories to bring their negative balance to zero.
    2.  [Reduce budgeted expenses](mydoc_budgeting_expenses#to-budget-money-into-a-category) in other categories until your budget balance is zero or positive. This offsets the increase in categories with overspending.
