**Payees** are the types of your income and expenses. They can be companies (where your paychecks come from), businesses (supermarkets or online stores), institutions (banks), services (food delivery or cleaning), or individuals (cash gifts). For example, if you often eat out, you might have **Restaurants** as a payee. If you own a car, you could add a **Gas Station** payee.

Depending on how detailed you want the budget to be, you can create payees with specific names. For example, adding different gas stations, such as Shell or BP, as multiple payees instead of a single **Gas Stations** payee allows you to compare how much money you spend on gas of each brand.
