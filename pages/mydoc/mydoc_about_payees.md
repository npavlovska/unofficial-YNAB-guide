**Payees** are types of income and expenses. They can be companies (where your paychecks come from), businesses (supermarkets or online stores), institutions (banks), services (food delivery or cleaning), or individuals (cash gifts). For example, if you often eat out, you might have **Restaurants** as a payee. If you own a car, you could add a **Gas Stations** payee.

Depending on how detailed you want the budget to be, you can create very specific payees. For example, you might add different gas stations as payees, such as **Gas: Shell** or **Gas: BP**, instead of broader **Gas Stations**. This way, you'll be able to compare how much money you spend on the gas of each brand.
