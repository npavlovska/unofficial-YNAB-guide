You can add a payee when [adding a transaction](mydoc_adding_transactions). Simply type the name in the Payee field of the transaction you are creating. YNAB instantly memorizes the new entry and adds it to a list of existing payees. When you create another transaction, this payee will be available from the payee drop-down list.
