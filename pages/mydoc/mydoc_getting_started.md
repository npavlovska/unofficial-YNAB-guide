This guide assumes that you already have a desktop version of YNAB.

It is not a complete YNAB user guide but an overview of the productâ€™s main functionality. With this document, you will learn how to create a budget, categorize expenses, set up accounts for different purposes, add payees, transfer funds between accounts, and record your income and spending in day-to-day inflow and outflow transactions.

To get your budget up and running, follow these planning steps:

1.  [Create a budget](mydoc_creating_budget.html).
2.  [Add budget categories](mydoc_creating_categories.html).
3.  [Create accounts](mydoc_creating_account).
4.  [Record monthly income with inflow transactions](mydoc_adding_transactions).
5.  [Budget monthly expenses](mydoc_budgeting_expenses).

After you finish with the planning steps, start recording your day-to-day payments as they occur.
