If some of your payments occur at regular intervals, you can schedule them. Use this option for repeated expenses, such as rent, utilities, and subscriptions, as well as your paycheck in case you receive it consistently once or several times per month.

You can also schedule one-time transactions that could serve as a reminder to make a certain payment.

You need to review all scheduled transactions on the date they are due and either [approve or reject them](#to-approve-or-reject-a-scheduled-transaction).

## To add a scheduled transaction:

1.  In the blue navigation pane on the left, select an account under which you wish to make a scheduled transaction. <br/>This opens a list of account transactions.

2.  At the bottom of the transactions list, click the **Scheduled Transactions** button. <br/>{% include inline_image.html
file="ScheduledButton.png" alt="Scheduled Transaction button" %} <br/>This expands a list of scheduled transactions.

3.  In the scheduled transactions list, click + Schedule a new transaction. <br/>This creates an empty scheduled transaction.

4.  Fill in the details:
    *  **Date**. Set the date on which you want the first scheduled transaction to occur.
    *  **Frequency**. Select how often you want to repeat the transaction.
    *  **Payee**. Type in a new [payee](mydoc_about_payees) or select an existing one from the drop-down list.

        {% include note.html content="When you type in a new payee, it is instantly added to a list of memorized payees." %}

    *  **Category**. Select a [budget category](mydoc_about_categories) from the drop-down list.

        {% include note.html content="When adding a scheduled transaction in an off-budget account, you will not see the **Category** field. Transactions in off-budget accounts do not have budget categories." %}

    *  **Memo**. Add a personal memo (optional).

5.  Specify the transaction amount:
    *  For income, type in the amount in the **Inflow** field.
    *  For expense, type in the amount in the **Outflow** field.

        {% include note.html content="You can leave the **Inflow/Outflow** field empty and specify the amount when approving the transaction on the date it occurs." %}

        {% include tip.html content="Optionally, you can [colour tag a transaction](mydoc_tagging_transactions) by clicking the dimmed flag on the left side and selecting one of the offered coloured flags." %}

6.  Click **Save**. <br/>If you want to add one more scheduled transaction, click **Save and add another**.

## To approve or reject a scheduled transaction:

On a set date, the scheduled transaction is transferred to a list of account transactions. It appears highlighted in bold.
{% include image.html file="Scheduled_OnDate.png" alt="Approving or rejecting a transaction" %}

<br/>**Approve or reject** a scheduled transaction in one of the following ways:
*  Double-click the transaction and select the desired option.
*  Click the blue **info (i)** button and select the desired option in the pop-up box.
