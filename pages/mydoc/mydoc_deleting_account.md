If you want to remove an account permanently, you have to [close it](mydoc_closing_account) first.

{% include warning.html content="You cannot delete an account that contains transactions. First, you need to empty the account by [removing its transactions](mydoc_deleting_transactions) or [reassigning them](mydoc_reassigning_transactions)." %}

## To delete an account:

1. In the Closed Accounts section in the blue navigation pane on the left, right-click the account you want to delete. <br/>This opens the **Edit Account** window.
    {% include image.html file="DeleteAccount.png" alt="Deleting an account" %}

2.  Click **Delete Account** at the bottom.

3.  In the dialog box that opens, confirm your action.
