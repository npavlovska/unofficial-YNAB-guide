If you happen to close an account by mistake, or you want to start using the closed account again, you can always reopen it.

## To reopen an account:

1. In the **Closed Accounts** section in the blue navigation pane on the left, right-click the account you wish to reopen. <br/>This opens the **Edit Account** window.
    {% include image.html file="DeleteAccount.png" alt="Reopening an account" %}

2. Click **Reopen Account** in the lower left corner.

{% include links.html %}
